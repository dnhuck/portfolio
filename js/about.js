                    My name is david huck and I am a web developer with a primary focus on front end development and the UX/UI experience. I use a wide variety of languages and layouts. I'm talking things like html, css, javascript, wordpress, bootstrap, flexbox, and a lot of other ones. I am set to graduate from DMACC in may of 2021 and I want to start working as soon as possible. One more thing to know about me is that when I am not coding or working on web dev related things, I run my own production business specializing in web dev(mainly wordpress),  photography,  and videography with plans to expand into design and marketing. So if you like what you hear go ahead and contact me below.
